**Seventh International Workshop on Languages for Modelling Variability (MODEVAR 2024b)**
*colocated with [SPLC'24](https://2024.splc.net)*


---
Feature models were invented in 1990 and have been recognised as one of the main contributions to the Software Product Line community. Although there have been several attempts to establish and study a sort of standard variability modelling language (e.g., OVM, CVL, TVL,..) there is still no consensus on a simple feature modelling language. There can be many motivations to have one but among others, there is one that is very important: information sharing among researchers, tools or developers. 

This meeting, following the spirit of the previous MODEVAR workshops, plans to be a full-day, interactive event where all participants shall share knowledge about how to build up a simple feature model language that all the community can agree on.

The event will be held colocated with the 28Th ACM International Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC 2024)

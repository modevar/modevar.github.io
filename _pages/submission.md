## Topics

Mainly, we invite Lightning Talk proposals considering topics related to variability modelling languages:

* Concepts: domain modelling, language constructs, mapping to other artefacts.
* Usages: writing, reading, generating, reverse engineering, (de-)composition, benchmarking.
* Tools: (collaborative) editing, storage/repositories, exchange, translation to other representations, analyses and testing.
* Analysing existing languages and approaches: Feature Modelling, Decision Modelling, OVM, UML-based, KConfig, Delta-Oriented Modelling, CVL, TVL, etc.

Details on the way of subission will follow.

## Topics

Mainly, we invite submissions considering topics related to variability modelling languages:

* Concepts: domain modelling, language constructs, mapping to other artefacts.
* Usages: writing, reading, generating, reverse engineering, (de-)composition, benchmarking.
* Tools: (collaborative) editing, storage/repositories, exchange, translation to other representations, analyses and testing.
* Analysing existing languages and approaches: Feature Modelling, Decision Modelling, OVM, UML-based, KConfig, Delta-Oriented Modelling, CVL, TVL, etc.

The topics are not limited to the list above. Particularly, we invite submissions addressing the scope of the [VaMoS](https://vamos2024.inf.unibe.ch/cfp/) conference.

## Submission

MODEVAR will receive your submissions via a separate MODEVAR EasyChair instance. The link will be published soon.

* Usages: writing, reading, generating, reverse engineering, (de-)composition, benchmarking.
* Tools: (collaborative) editing, storage/repositories, exchange, translation to other representations, analyses and testing.
* Analysing existing languages and approaches: Feature Modelling, Decision Modelling, OVM, UML-based, KConfig, Delta-Oriented Modelling, CVL, TVL, etc.

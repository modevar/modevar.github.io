The MODEVAR workshop is planned as full day event at **February 3rd, 2025** in Rennes, France. The main objective of the afternoon discussions is to **outline research directions to further develop UVL and variability modeling in general**. In this MODEVAR workshop edition, there will be no formal proceedings. The program will mainly consist of lightning talks by the participants, plenary discussions as well as discussions in smaller groups.

Title: **The Search for the GREAL**

### Abstract 
The research community has achieved a great success in the standardization of the Universal Variability Language (UVL), a language for defining, creating, and managing variations in products and services. However UVL only partially fulfills the vision of orthogonal variability engineering. Missing is how the variability is realized with respect to the assets of a product line. In this talk, we investigate how the core principle that led to the UVL success could be applied to come up with the GREAL: a Generic REAlization Language.
We identify openness, flexibility, declarativity and reusability as key aspects for managing realization of variability across industries, as well as using a layered approach to progressively fit more demanding contexts.

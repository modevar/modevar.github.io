The MODEVAR workshop is planned as a full day event at **September 1st, 2025** in A Coruña, Spain. In the current edition, we are combining MODEVAR workshop with Re:Volution to invite more discussion within the community and discover more ideas on improving UVL or variability modeling in general. Additionally, we provide a UVL tutorial to invite participants for trying out the latest capabilities of UVL. Using this tutorial, we want to gather feedback and future requirements for improving UVL capabilities.

Title: **Variability Modeling for and with Digital Twins**

### Abstract 

Due to the vast usage and importance of cyber-physical systems as a backbone of our society, the design, realization, operation, and maintenance of such systems are becoming more and more challenging. As an answer, digital twins are emerging in many domains and are gaining attention to support different phases of the system lifecycle such as design-space exploration, runtime adaptation, and predictive maintenance. While benefits of using digital twins are already demonstrated for different domains, the systematic development and operation of digital twins which represent complex software systems are still major challenges, especially when support for different variants and versions is required.

In my talk, I will first survey different modeling approaches for digital twins and show how existing engineering models are used for deriving digital twin models. Second, I will present a variability modeling approach for managing digital twin architectures. Finally, I will discuss the important role of variability modeling for digital twins and how variability modeling is pushed towards the runtime of systems by leveraging digital twins.
